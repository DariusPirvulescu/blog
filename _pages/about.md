I am Darius, a tech and nature enthusiast from Transylvania, Romania.    
Currently based in Lisbon.   
I am passionate about too many things: gardening, mushrooms, psychology, social engineering, psychedelics, dogs with sunglasses and dog-watching, to name a few.

Nowadays, I am teaching myself Cybersecurity, looking to get into that field one (ethical) way or another.
